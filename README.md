# OSGiJavaFX
OSGi bundle (`JavaFX` and `JavaFXImpl`) to launch JavaFX application and service definition (`FXApplication`) to provide access to the primary stage of the JavaFX `Application`.

This is a component created with OSGi Declarative Services and provides a simple launcher for JavaFX applications.

For an example of how to use this, see [winnall/OSGiJavaFXUsage](https://github.com/winnall/OSGiJavaFXUsage), which describes a very simple case. However, this component is not yet ready for the Big Time.
