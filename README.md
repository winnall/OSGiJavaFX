# OSGiJavaFX
OSGi bundle (`JavaFXLauncher`) to launch JavaFX application, and service definition (`JavaFXApplication` and `AbstractJavaFXApplication`) to provide access to the primary stage of the JavaFX `Application`.

This is a component created with OSGi Declarative Services and provides a simple launcher for JavaFX applications.

For an example of how to use this, see [winnall/OSGiJavaFXUsage](https://github.com/winnall/OSGiJavaFXUsage), which describes a very simple case.
